The scope of this data group includes a wide range of psychological and social therapies, not limited to:
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT),
- Narrative therapy,
- Family Therapy,
- Group Therapy,
- Social Skills Training,
- Assertiveness training,
- Anger management,
- Interpersonal Therapy (IPT),
- Grief counselling,
- Motivational Interviewing,
- Crisis Intervention,
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction,
- Art therapy, and
- Music therapy

Record one instance per careflow step or event for each therapeutic activity in a health record. If the therapy consists of a single activity, the 'Therapy provided' and the 'Therapy completed' careflow step may be recorded simultaneously. However, if the therapy consists of multiple component activities, record a separate instance of the 'Therapy provided' careflow step for each component activity provided, and record the 'Therapy completed' step only after the final component activity has been provided.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record other types of therapy or interventions. Use the ACTION.procedure for procedures. The need for other specific archetypes reflecting other types of therapy is acknowledged but have not yet been developed.">
